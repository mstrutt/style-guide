Centralising some code style options the suit me well, fully opinionated but usually with reason.

## General

### Indentation

Tabs over spaces, for one simple reason: developer affordance. If one developer finds indentation of 2 more readable, and finds 4 more readable, that should be fine. Using tabs allows an editor to define the size of a tab, without any changes to the source code.

To that end, keep things simple, just one tab per nesting will do, no need to indent multiple times to line something up.
